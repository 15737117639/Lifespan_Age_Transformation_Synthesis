## Overview
Lifespan Age Transformation Synthesis is a GAN based method designed to simulate the countinuous aging process from a single input image.<br>
This code is the official PyTorch implementation of the paper:

## Ethics & Bias statement
### Intended use:
 - This algorithm is designed to simulate the aging proccess and produce an **_approximation_** of a person's appearance throughout his/her/their lifespan. 
 - The main usecases of this method are approximating the appearance of missing people or for art and entertainment purposes (CGI effects, Camera filters, etc.).
 - **_The results of this method should not be used as grounds for detention/arrest of a person or as any other from of legal evidence under any circumstances_**

### Algorithm & data bias:<br>
We have devoted maximal efforts in our algorithm design to ensure that the identity of the person in the input image is preserved and no inherent dataset biases are introduced at the output. These measures include:
1. Designing identity encoder architecture to preserve the local structures of the input image. This plays a key role in maintaining the person's identity at the output.
2. Including losses that were designed to maintain the person's identity in our training scheme. These losses make sure that the encoded identity features are consistent across ages (latent identity loss), that the network can reproduce the original image from its output (cycle loss) and that the network learns to reconstruct the input if the target age class is the same as the source age class as the (self-reconstruction loss).
3. To avoid introducing any gender bias in the dataset to the results, e.g. producing male facial features for females at a ceratin age range or vice versa, we have trained two separate models, one for males and one for females. Our dataset contains binary gender labels, which we used to select the training and testing data for each model. On the other hand, our algorithmic pipeline does not contain any gender classification of the input image, the decision of which model to apply is left for the user. We acknowledge that gender is non-binary and that our design choices restrict our algorithm from simulating the aging process of people whose gender is non-binary. Further work is required to make sure future algorithms will be able to simulate aging for the entire gender spectrum.

Despite these measures, we are aware that the network might still introduce other biases that we didn't consider when we designed the algorithm. If you spot any bias in the results, please inform us, so that we can make an effort to correct it.

## Pre-Requisits
You must have a **GPU with CUDA support** in order to run code.

This code requires **PyTorch** to be installed, please go to [Pytorch.org](https://pytorch.org/) for installation info.<br>
We tested our code on PyTorch 1.4.0, but the code should run on any PyTorch version above 1.0.0.

Overall, the following python packages should be installed:
1. torch (PyTorch)
2. torchvision
3. opencv-python
4. visdom
5. dominate
6. numpy
7. pillow
8. ntpath

If any of these packages are not installed on your computer, you can install them using the supplied `requirements.txt` file:<br>
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Quick Demo (Coming soon)
Try running the method on your own image...<br> 
```Coming soon```

## Get Started
1. To start working with the code you need to download the FFHQ-Aging dataset. Go to the [FFHQ-Aging dataset repo](https://github.com/royorel/FFHQ-Aging-Dataset) and follow the instructions to download the data.

2. Prune & organize the raw FFHQ-Aging dataset into age classes:
```
cd datasets
python create_dataset.py --folder [path to raw FFHQ-Aging] [--train_split] [num of training images (default=69000)]
```

3. Download pretrained models (Optional, coming soon)<br>
```coming soon```

## Usage
### Training:
1. Open a visdom port to view loss plots and intermediate results. Run ```visdom``` and monitor results at [http://localhost:8097](http://localhost:8097). If you run the code on a remote server open ```http://hostname:8097``` instead.
2. Open ```run_scripts/train.sh``` (Linux) or ```run_scripts/train.bat``` (windows) and set:
  - The dataset relative path ```--dataroot```
  - The model name ```--name```
  - The GPUs you indend to use ```--gpu_ids``` as well as the ```CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES``` environment variable. 
  - The batch size ```--batchSize``` according to your GPU's maximum RAM capacity and the number of GPU's available.
3. Train the model: Run```./run_scripts/train.sh``` (Linux) or ```./run_scripts/train.bat``` (windows)

### Testing:
1. Open ```run_scripts/test.sh``` (Linux) or ```run_scripts/test.bat``` (windows) and set:
  - The dataset relative path ```--dataroot```
  - The model name ```--name```
2. Test the model: Run```./run_scripts/train.sh``` (Linux) or ```./run_scripts/train.bat``` (windows)

### Generate Video
1. Prepare a ```.txt``` file with a list of image paths to generate videos for, omit the file extentions. See examples in ```males_image_list.txt``` and ```females_image_list.txt```
2. Open ```run_scripts/traversal.sh``` (Linux) or ```run_scripts/traversal.bat``` (windows) and set:
  - The dataset relative path ```--dataroot```
  - The model name ```--name```
  - The relative path to the image list ```--image_path_file```
3. Run ```./run_scripts/traversal.sh``` (Linux) or ```./run_scripts/traversal.bat``` (windows)
